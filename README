A script package for an advanced cubit interface. Provides a lot of functionality, that is not
included in the official python interface.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install the package, run:

python setup.py install

Note, that Cubit only supports python 2.7 under Linux and python 2.6 under MacOs. Choose the
according python executable. To install as a normal user, use the --user flag for the installation.

USAGE
-----

Import the module into python. The module must be initialized prior to usage. To do so, run:

import advcubit
advcubit.init(cubitPath)

The init() function expects the path to the Cubit installation. If the parameter is not provided,
it will try to use the environment variable $CUBIT_PATH.
All functions are directly accessible, even though they are organized in different modules.
To start Cubit, use

advcubit.startCubit()

To directly access the cubit python interface, you must import the cubit module after the initalization
of advcubit. It will be added to the python import path.

import advcubit
advcubit.init(cubitPath)
import cubit
