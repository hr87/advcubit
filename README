A script package for an advanced cubit interface. Provides a lot of functionality, that is not
included in the official python interface.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install the package, run:

python setup.py install

Note, that Cubit only supports python 2.7 under Linux and python 2.6 under MacOs. Choose the
according python executable. To install as a normal user, use the --user flag for the installation, e.g.

python2.6 setup.py install --user # for MacOs as normal user

USAGE
-----

Import the module into python. The module must be initialized prior to usage. To do so, run:

import advcubit
advcubit.init(cubitPath, silent)

The init() function expects the path to the Cubit installation. If the parameter is not provided,
it will try to use the environment variable $CUBIT_PATH. This can be set by

export CUBIT_PATH="path/to/Cubit/"

The second parameter is a flag to echo the commands performed. The default is silent.

All functions are directly accessible, even though they are organized in different modules.
To start Cubit, use

advcubit.startCubit()

To directly access the cubit python interface, you must import the cubit module after the initialization
of advcubit. It will be added to the python import path.

import advcubit
advcubit.init(cubitPath)
import cubit

EXAMPLES
--------

Examples are provides in the examples directory. The examples available at the moment are:

basic.py -> shows a simple script using advcubit
cmd.py -> demonstrates the difference of cubit.cmd and advcubit.cmd


TESTS
-----

To run the tests, simply execute the run_tests.py scripts with the correct python interpreter. To run
the tests, $CUBIT_PATH must be set. To implement tests, please take a look at the already provided tests.
The framework already exists, the tests just need to be implemented and added to the according module's
test suite. For options executing the tests, please refer to the unittest documentation:

https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/unittest.html MacOs python 2.6
https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html Linux python 2.7
